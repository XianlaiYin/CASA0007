### Description of Inspirational Academic Paper
本文基于美国1970年至2010的人口结构变化，分析其可能对住房需求和供应产生的不同影响，并进一步评估其相关因素对房价变化产生的影响，以预测未来房价趋势。本文认为，人口结构因素的影响可以占到房价增长的40.54%，并预测未来美国房价将保持增长。
Based on demographic changes in the US from 1970 to 2010, this paper analyses the different effects they may have on the housing market, and further assess the impact of their associated factors on house price changes to forecast future housing market trends. The paper concludes that the impact of demographic factors can account for 40.54% of house price changes and predicts that US house prices will maintain growth in the future.

### Value of Research Question
2021年以来，长期高周转运行的中国住房市场走到了悬崖边缘，诸多知名房地产企业深陷债务危机。同年公布的中国第七次人口普查揭示了中国人口结构存在的巨大隐患，人口老龄化、低出生率等人口结构问题均会在需求端对住房市场产生难以阻挡的影响。在这样的背景下，分析人口结构的变化对中国主要城市住房市场的影响，并预测其未来发展趋势，可以帮助制定相应政策以应对潜在的危机，引导中国住房市场可持续发展。
Since 2021, China's housing market, which has been running at high turnover for a long time, has reached the edge of a precipice, with many well-known real estate companies in deep debt. The seventh population census released in the same year revealed the huge potential problems of China's demographic structure, the ageing population, and low birth rate all having an unstoppable impact on the housing market on the demand side. In this context, analysing the impact of demographic changes on the housing market in China's major cities and forecasting its future trends, can help formulate policies to address potential crises and guide sustainable development.
